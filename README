ARNotations
===========

ARNotations is a Ruby on Rails plugin to map any kind of ActiveRecord model
to a Topic Map Fragment, providing the ability to expose them TMExplore
compatible using REST.

Dependencies
===========
Currently ARNotations only depends on the libxml gem.
Unfortunately this means it does currently *not* work with JRuby.

Installation
===========
As stated in the dependencies section, you need to install the libxml gem using:
e.g. by "gem install libxml"
After that you can use mercurial to install ARNotions in your Rails application root:
" hg clone https://arnotations.googlecode.com/hg vendor/plugins/ar_notations"
For updates just change into "vendor/plugins/ar_notations" and do a quick
"hg pull -u"
For actually arnotating your Application have a look at the examples provided.

Example
=======

Some examples how to "arnotate" your model:
Give some typical ActiveRecord class like:

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
   validates_presence_of :firstname, :lastname, :identifier

   has_and_belongs_to_many :publications, :class_name => 'Publication', :join_table => :authors_publications

   translates :description
end

You would simply add:

#..for things that should be represented as Topic Names
has_name  :lastname, :psi => "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/familyName"
has_name  :firstname , :psi => "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/givenName"

#..for things that should be represented as Topic Occurrences
has_occurrence :description

#..for associations
has_association :publications,
   {:name => "authorship", :psi => "http://psi.topicmapslab.de/tml/authorship"},
   {:name => "has author", :psi => "http://psi.topicmapslab.de/tml/work"},
   {:name => "is author of", :psi => "http://psi.topicmapslab.de/tml/author"}

to your model.
In your controller e.g. the PeopleController
add "format.xtm {render :xml =>  @person.to_xtm2}" to your "show" Method, and
"format.xtm {"render :xml =>  @people = Person.all.to_xtm2 }"
to your "index" Method, and given you use the default RoR routing (with ".:format")
or request content type "application/xtm+xml" those Methods will return you some
nice explorable Topic Map fragments.
